# iPhone 8 Crash Investigation Plan

## Current Information
- Reported on iPhone 8 with iOS 16.7.10b
- Mentioned during device rotation
- Not reproducible on iPhone XR
- Not reproducible in regular testing
- App already has portrait-only setting in Info.plist

## Investigation Steps

1. Gather More Information
   - Complete crash logs/stack trace
   - Steps to reproduce (exact user actions)
   - Was audio playing at the time?
   - How long was app running before crash?
   - Does it happen consistently or randomly?

2. Device-Specific Testing
   - Test on multiple iPhone 8 devices
   - Test with different iOS versions
   - Monitor memory usage during testing
   - Try different combinations of:
     * Audio playback
     * WebView content loading
     * Device rotation attempts
     * Background/foreground transitions

3. Analysis Points
   - Compare behavior between iPhone 8 and newer devices
   - Check if crash is related to memory constraints
   - Verify if rotation lock is working consistently
   - Monitor WebView memory usage

## Next Steps
1. Do not make code changes yet
2. Collect more crash reports if they occur
3. Try to establish a reliable reproduction pattern
4. Only implement fixes once we understand the exact cause

## Current Status
- App is working normally in testing
- Portrait mode is properly configured in Info.plist
- No consistent reproduction steps identified
- May be an isolated incident

## Note
Keep this investigation plan for reference, but don't implement any code changes until:
1. We can reproduce the issue consistently
2. We have complete crash logs
3. We understand the exact conditions causing the crash
