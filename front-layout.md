# Front Layout Analysis and Solution Plan

## Current Issues
1. Overflow in areas marked with red borders:
   - Area above/below play/pause button
   - Image container area
   - Overall screen height adaptability

## Layout Requirements
1. Must be fully responsive to ANY device size
2. Zero overflow errors
3. Maintain play controls visibility
4. Preserve image aspect ratio
5. Keep metadata text readable

## Core Solution Strategy

### 1. Container Hierarchy
```
Scaffold
└── SafeArea
    └── Column (main container)
        ├── Flexible/Expanded (top section - image)
        │   └── AspectRatio (maintain image proportions)
        ├── Text sections (metadata)
        └── Expanded (bottom section)
            └── Play controls centered
```

### 2. Key Layout Rules
- Use `Expanded` and `Flexible` widgets strategically
- Implement `AspectRatio` for image containment
- Apply `BoxConstraints` where needed
- Utilize `SingleChildScrollView` only if absolutely necessary

### 3. Specific Solutions

#### Image Area
- Wrap in `Flexible` with `fit: FlexFit.tight`
- Use `AspectRatio` (16/9) for consistent scaling
- Apply `BoxFit.contain` for image fitting

#### Play Controls Section (Critical)
- Divide bottom section into three `Expanded` widgets:
  ```
  Expanded (bottom section)
  ├── Expanded (flexible space above)
  ├── Play controls (fixed height)
  └── Expanded (flexible space below)
  ```
- Each `Expanded` space will automatically adjust to screen size
- Play controls remain fixed size in the middle
- Both spaces above and below will grow/shrink equally

#### Text Content
- Use `AutoSizeText` for dynamic text scaling
- Apply `maxLines` and `overflow` properties
- Implement proper text wrapping

## Implementation Priority
1. Container structure
2. Image scaling
3. Play controls positioning
4. Text handling
5. Overall responsiveness testing

## Testing Criteria
- Test on multiple screen sizes
- Verify no overflow on rotation
- Ensure play controls always accessible
- Check image scaling maintains quality
- Validate text readability at all sizes
